## Introduction
We present in this work the intersection of Deep Learning-based and empirical Molecular docking tools for the ligand-target interaction. The first part of the work relies on Deep Learning, in this case, we used [DeepPurpose](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose), the second part on Molecular docking tool [Autodock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/). The molecular docking involves two main internal steps : extract the most promising binding sites from the protein structures, and compute the energy of the pose made of the ligand located in the most promising protein's binding sites.
